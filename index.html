                    <h1>My name is Paul Meinshausen</h1>
                    <p>I am a data scientist who cares more about science than I do about data.
                     But I don't think there's just one Science. Paul Feyeraband put it this way
                     in his book Against Method: 
                    </p>
                    <div style="float: right; clear: left;"><IMG src="/images/paul_meinshausen.jpg"></div>
                    <p style>"Successful research does not obey general
                     standards; it relies now on one trick, now on another; the moves that 
                     advance it and the standards that define what counts as an advance are not
                     always known to the movers. A theory of science that devises standards
                     and structural elements for all scientific activities and authorizes
                     them by reference to 'Reason' or 'Rationality' may impress outsiders --
                     but it is much too crude an instrument for the people on the spot,
                     that is, for scientists facing some concrete research problem."
                    </p>
                    <p>At a more practical level, I love building software that can approximate
                    a human-devised solution to a problem and implement it at scale. Then I love
                    taking the data that is generated by that software and exploring and exploiting
                    it to improve the software and the solution to the original problem. Even more
                    exciting is when I can use statistical analysis of data to generate solutions 
                    for problems that weren't recognized or considered when I started working.
                    </p>
                    <p>I've practiced data science all over the world, and especially in Asia.
                    If you want to know more about me, you can see a short bio here.
